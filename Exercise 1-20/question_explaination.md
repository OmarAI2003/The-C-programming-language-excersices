The question is asking you to write a program that replaces tab characters (`\t`) in an input string with spaces, aligning text according to a fixed set of tab stops. These tab stops occur every **n** columns (e.g., every 4 or 8 spaces). 

The second part of the question asks whether `n` (the tab stop width) should be:
1. A **variable** (meaning it can be changed at runtime, e.g., based on user input)
2. A **symbolic parameter** (a constant defined at compile-time, such as using `#define TABSTOP 4` in C)

### Explanation:
- If `n` is a **symbolic parameter**, it means it is fixed and defined before compilation. This makes the program simpler but less flexible.
- If `n` is a **variable**, it allows the user to specify different tab stop widths dynamically, making the program more flexible.

### Answer:
It depends on the use case:
- If you want a **general-purpose program** that can work with different tab stop widths, `n` should be a **variable** (e.g., read from user input or a command-line argument).
- If you only need a fixed tab stop width (e.g., 8 spaces), then defining it as a **symbolic constant** is fine.

For a practical implementation, making `n` a **variable** is better because different environments may use different tab widths.
